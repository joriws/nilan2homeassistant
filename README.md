# nilan2homeassistant

This is a backup of code development project to optimally fetch values via
RS-485 modbus and upload via MQTT to Home Assistant with MQTT discovery
support.

As such the code is early development and debug, so it does not fulfil it's
function.

Development platform:
- Raspberry PI
- Nilan EC with CTS-602 compatible controller
- USB RS-485 adapter

Code lists environment variables which can be setup for correct USB-port,
modbus parameters etc.
